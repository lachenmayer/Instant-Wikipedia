So... How do I make this sound exciting.....

Imagine this: I'm reading a Wikipedia article with lots and lots of
really technical words I don't really care about, but hey, it'd be
cool if I could at least have a quick glance at what they actually
mean. So, with this Chrome extension I'm just gonna hover over that
fantastic blue link, and up pops all I really want from that article:
  
  THE OPENING PARAGRAPH!

Experts agree: This extension solves the NUMBER 1 PROBLEM affecting
all Wikipedia users! (http://xkcd.com/214/)
No more endless link clicking, just hover over it and get on with
what you REALLY came for.


Made with lots of JQuery magic.
Aww yeah.
